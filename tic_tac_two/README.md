# [tic-tac-two](https://wadoodabdul.github.io/games/tic_tac_two/src/tic_tac_two.html)

This game is a variation on tic-tac-toe with the following differences - 

1. The main grid is 5*5 instead of 3*3. But we have a movable 3*3 grid
2. There are 2 players. Each player gets 4 pieces
3. The players can take turns and place their pieces anywhere on the board(5*5)
4. After each player has made 2 or more moves, they have the following options - 
4a.  either place another piece
4b. move a previously placed piece in the 5*5 grid
4c. move the movable 3*3 grid by one space(right/left/up/down/diagonally)
5. This carries on until once of the player gets 3 in a row on the movable 3*3 grid.
